This script adds python syntax highlighting for:
 gtk gtk.gdk gtk.glade gobject rsvg atk cairo pango gnome

All highlighted items will only show up after a "." character. (e.g. threads_init() will not be highlighted but gtk.gdk.threads_init() will be)

gtk functions and gtk objects can be set to have different highlight values by adding 
IncludedFunction
IncludedFunction2
highlight groups in your colorscheme file.
