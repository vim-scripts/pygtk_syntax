pygtk_syntax.vim and python.vim should be put in

The 
 IncludedFunction 
 IncludedFunction2
functions may be set in your theme file for more control 
over the colors of individual items.

For example, 
 hi IncludedFunction gui=italic guifg=#9b00a6
 hi IncludedFunction2 guifg=#7200c9
will make functions like gtk.gdk.threads_init() show
up in itallic purple while objects like gtk.Widget
will show up in non-itallic purple

Syntax files were created with 
 ./syntaxgen.py gtk gtk.gdk gtk.glade gobject rsvg atk cairo pango gnome
